# **11ASE 2025 Task 1 - API Application**
## By **Levin Shao**
----------------------------------------------
## **Requirements Definition**
### **Functional Requirements**
* **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 

  The application must allow users to retrieve specific data from an open-source API.
* **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?

  The application must provide a user-friendly interface for efficient interaction.
* **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system? 

  The application must display the retrieved data to the user in a readable format. On top of that, the user must be restricted from modifying the API in any way.
### **Non-Functional Requirements**
* **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform? 

  The application should perform efficiently and run smoothly on any device, including older and less stable systems. Performance should be maintained when using different platforms, so the user can user is confident that they can run it on their computer. The system should also be optimized so that the application won't cause any problems to the device (e.g. freezing, crashing) when ran.
* **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?

  The system and data provided must be highly reliable to ensure users receive the most accurate and up-to-date information. The system must also store the user's data securely to prevent any security flaws from happening. It must be reliable enough to protect the user's data to the best of its ability.
* **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?

  The user interface should be intuitive, accessible and very easy to navigate even for users with limited technical expertise, as we need to make sure that ANYONE can easily and effectively access and use the application without problems.
## **Determining Specifications**
### **Functional Specifications**
* **User Requirements:** What does the user need to do?

   The user needs to be able to easily navigate the application even if they have never encountered it before, hopefully even without the manual.
* **Inputs & Outputs:** What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?
The system will need to accept mainly number inputs since the program uses numbers to control and direct the program based on the user's options.
* **Core Features:** At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?
The program need to show the us
* **User Interaction:** How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?
* **Error Handling:** What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?
### **Non Functional Specifications**
* **Performance:** How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?
* **Usability & Accessibility:** How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?
* **Reliability:** 
What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Duplicate data? API retrieval crash?
