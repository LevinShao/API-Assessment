## **Requirements Definition**
### **Functional Requirements**
* **Data Retrieval:** The application must allow users to retrieve specific data from an open-source API.
* **User Interface:** The application must provide a user-friendly interface for efficient interaction.
* **Data Display:** The application must display the retrieved data to the user in a readable format. On top of that, the user must be restricted from modifying the API in any way.
### **Non-Functional Requirements**
* **Performance:** The application should perform efficiently and run smoothly on any device, including older and less stable systems. Performance should be maintained when using different platforms, so the user can user is confident that they can run it on their computer. The system should also be optimized so that the application won't cause any problems to the device (e.g. freezing, crashing) when ran.
* **Reliability:** The system and data provided must be highly reliable to ensure users receive the most accurate and up-to-date information. The system must also store the user's data securely to prevent any security flaws from happening. It must be reliable enough to protect the user's data to the best of its ability.
* **Usability and Accessibility:** The user interface should be intuitive, accessible and very easy to navigate even for users with limited technical expertise, as we need to make sure that ANYONE can easily and effectively access and use the application without problems.
